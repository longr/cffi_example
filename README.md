# CFFI - Python and C example.

This will mature into something better, but for now it is notes and scriblings as I fumble through running C code in python using cffi.  Links tho pages that have been used to achieve this are listed at the bottom.  Main source of knowledge has been Dimitri Merejkowsky's lets build chuck norris, and the code for this (point) comes from Jim Anderson's contribution on dbader.org



## Build and install
Build using
```
python setup.py sdist
```

and then install by doing:

```
pip install . --user
```


## Running.

Run the code using following commands:

```
import Point
new_point = point.Point(2, 3)
new_point.show_point()
```


## How it works.

### Modules / package
Not entirly sure. __init__.py needed so that python knows it is a module. This needs to contain
```
from point import Point
```
otherwise to run the code you need:

```
from point.point import Point
a = Point(2, 3)
```
or
```
import point
point.point.Point()
```

### setup.py

Needed to install packages.  Also calls files to build our c library.

```
from setuptools import setup#, find_packages

setup(name='point',
      version='0.1',
      #packages=find_packages(), #still builds, maynot be needed.
      description='dbader point',
      #py_modules=['point'], ?? What does this do?
      setup_requires=['cffi'],
      cffi_modules=['point/build_point.py:ffi'],
      install_requires=['cffi'],
)
```
name, version, and descrition are obvious.
- TODO: google diff between setup requires and install requires.
```cffi_modules``` is a list of modules for cffi to run for building the c code. Syntax is:
```
<path_to_module>/<build_file>:<name_of_FFI_object_instance)
```
#### py_modules

This is not needed at this level.. Just used for.        #py_modules=['point'], ?? What does this do?
      # explanation here  https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/issues/397


### build_point.py

Should read CFFI docs at https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ to explain this file.

create an instance of FFI() (name it that same as we did in the ```cffi_modules``` line of ```setup.py```

```
ffi = cffi.FFI()
```

Then we use ```cdef``` to declare the functions, variables, and so on that we have defined in out c code and want to access from our C extenion.  # https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cdef.html#ffi-cdef-declaring-types-and-functions.  These are usually the things in your .h file(s)

Could do this manually as:

```
ffi.cdef(
	"""
	/* Simple structure for ctypes example */
	typedef struct {
	    int x;
	    int y;
	    } Point;

	void show_point(Point point);
	void move_point(Point point);
	void move_point_by_ref(Point *point);
	Point get_default_point(void);
	Point get_point(int x, int y);
	""")
```

If we want all accessible, or don't mind, then we could do:

```
with open("src/point.h") as f:
    ffi.cdef(f.read())
```

which instructs python to read in our point.h and send the contents to ```ffc.cdef```.  This fits better with DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself).

Next we need to tell ```ffi``` about our source files (the .c and associated files.)

```
# set_source is where you specify all the include statements necessary
# for your code to work and also where you specify additional code you
# want compiled up with your extension, e.g. custom C code you've written
#
# set_source takes mostly the same arguments as distutils' Extension, see:
# https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cdef.html#ffi-set-source-preparing-out-of-line-modules
# https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.core.Extension     
ffi.set_source("point._point",
               '#include "point.h"',
               include_dirs=['src/'],
               sources=['src/point.c'],
               extra_compile_args=['--std=c99'])
```

First argument is ***** which is usually the name of the directory containing the python module, followed by a dot, followed by an underscore, and then the name of the c library. ******EXPLAIN******

**** REASON FOR .h?? *********
The next are more obvious, any directories we need to include for it to be able to compile, we put in a list and pass to ```include_dirs```.  Same with source files.

Finally we need to run the compile method on our ```ffi``` object so that is will compile our c library.

```
ffi.compile(verbose=False)
```



### calling the library from python

Next we need to call out module from python. We need a python file that can import this compiled library.  The first thing we need to do in this file is import the our compiled library.

```
import _<library_name>
```

in the case of this example, that is:

```
import _point
```

Then we can access the methods and functions by doing:

```
<imported_module>.lib.<method/function/variable>
```

which again for our case is:

```
_point.lib.get_point(x, y)
```

### Layout
Layout is perhaps optional, but a module layout with module_name, and src is cleaner.

Basic tree is:


```
.---point
|   |--- build_point.py
|   |--- __init__.py
|   \--- point.py
|--- README.md
|--- setup.py
\--- src
     |--- point.c
     \--- point.h
```

NEED TO CHECK THIS.  PEP420 specifys namespace, new layout may be needed.


### Manifest

Need a `MANIFEST.in` and need to specify inclussion of `.h` files.  Need to check the reasoning behind this.

## Speed

Four functions are implemented in here, `fib` and `fast_fib` which are pure python functions; and `cfib` and `cfast_fib` which are C functions ran using cffi. There are 2 examples of code here that aim to show: how C code can be called from python, how C code called from python is faster, and how re-writing code can get you faster than the C code (although the c implementation is faster still): `fib` is a slow implementation for finding the nth fibonacci number that uses recursion (and gets slower with higher numbers), and `fast_fib` is a much better way of achiving the same task. Both of these have C implementations. The time taken to run each function is listed below.

```
In [1]: import fibonacci as fib

In [2]: %timeit fib.fib(33)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.37 s per loop

In [3]: %timeit fib.cfib(33)
10 loops, best of 3: 22.5 ms per loop

In [4]: %timeit fib.fast_fib(33)
The slowest run took 12.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.34 Âµs per loop

In [5]: %timeit fib.cfast_fib(33)
The slowest run took 63.27 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 283 ns per loop
```

As we can see, the C implementation `cfib` is 60 times faster than the pure python `fib` function.  Re-writing this slow python function means that `fast_fib` is nearly 10,000 times faster than `cfib`, and is nearly 600,000 times faster than `fib`. `cfast_fib` is then faster still.  This result is highly dependant on the number chosen for `n`, but does show us the power of using C code over pure python code, and the power of well written code over poorly written code.

##Testing

Add details on using pytest.

Tests should be designed so that they test a single function by giving it an input (if needed) and checking that the output is the expected output.  Using `pytest` it is very simple to write tests like this.  First create a file called test_fibonacci.py (by convention all files with tests in should begin test_ ), and put a test in it:

```
def test_fib_check_tenth():
    assert fibonacci.fib(10) == 55
```

This is just a single function that uses the `assert` statement.  All tests should be inside a function, with a function name beginning `test_`.  In this case we are checking that the 10th fibonacci numbe
r is 55.  If it is, then the test will pass - if not it will fail.

We run this test by either, calling pytest by itself, giving it the file name as an argument, or giving it the path to a directory containing tests.  

```
python -m pytest test_fibonacci.py

[longr@localhost cffi_example]$ python -m pytest fibonacci/tests/test_fibonnaci.py

### Putting tests into a project.

As we are building a module, we will want to tidy things up a little and put them into our package structure.  The best way is to have directory called tests inside each module (remember that a module is a directory containing the file `__init__.py`.

What we also want is to run those tests from setup.py.  To do this we need to add some new lines to setup.py to tell it about our tests.

``
      setup_requires=['cffi','pytest-runner'],
      test_require=['pytest'],
``
First we need to add pytest-runner to the `setup_requires` line as we will use this to run the tests. Then we need to let setup know that our tests will need `pytest` to run.

We now need to create a new file called `setup.cfg` to modify how `setup.py` behaves.

```
[aliases]
test=pytest

[tool:pytest]
addopts = --verbose
```
We specify in here some aliases so that when setup.py wants to run tests, it knows to run pytest instead of the inbuilt test.

Then we specify the command line arguments we wish to pass to pytest, in this case, `--verbose`.





#Questions

- Data files, use pkg_resoucres
- Tr y and figure out how matplotlib or numpy does its C code.


## To Do.
- Tidy up last few comments and code.
- Write one 'post'?
- Split into multiple?
- Restart a blog?
  - python and cffi.
  - packaging python
  - my hovercraft is full of eels
  - letting go with git.
  Eventually:
  - calling c code from R and Python the easy way.
- Add documentations
- Consider adding a 'case-study' or 'why you should' or 'Alice and Bob story' at the beginning of each tutorial / instruction.
