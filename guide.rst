Python Packaging Example
========================



Introduction
============

There are lots of resources explaining how to package, test, document and otherwise implement features and styles that will make your python code better and moe sustainable.  However many of these are hidden unless you search for the exact terms, or are not specific enough, or are to specific. These guide hopes to give an opinionated (it won't suggest alternative tools, just pick ones the authors prefer and explain how to use them and only them).   This repositry itself will act as an example of all the features and suggestions.
